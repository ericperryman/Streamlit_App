Hello! My name is Eric Perryman and this is my final project for my UNCC DSBA-5122 Masters course.

Introduction:

In early October 2024, Hurricane Helene devestated parts of the United States, and Western North Carolina was one of the worst places that got hit. 
With the many diverse species that we have here in our state, I believe it is important to understand the ecological impact that this hurricane could have had
on the communities within the region. 
By analyzing the data, we can see the numerous species that may need to be re-surveyed depending on their habitat and area within the impacted zone. 

Data:
To obtain this data, I reached out to the Horth Carolina Natural Heritage Program and requested access. They were very kind and granted me access to work on my project.
Within the provided data, I chose to select Buncombe, Rutherford, and Yancey county to use in my project since early reports from the Hurricane indicated that these
three counties were severely impacted.

Future Work:
I really wish I had more time to work on this project for this class, but I know I will continue to work on it in the future even when I am not in this course. 
I believe it is an importand project and I am enjoying building an application with this data. I want to add more detail on the Statuses and what they indicate to provide 
a better picture to the viewer what exactly the designations mean and I want to provide more visualizations, particularly with maps if I am able to do so.
